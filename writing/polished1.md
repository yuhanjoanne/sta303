**Soft skills**

The company is seeking individuals that can work in collaborative environment. I have created a GitHub account and will try to collaborate on the final project with my team over GitHub. I believe this experience of collaboration is in line with the soft skills that the company wants. 

The company also wants employees that can communicate key insights to stakeholders. I have been writing weekly writings for this course to strengthen my writing skills. In these writings, I was able to explain complicated statistical models and concepts to people without much statistical backgrounds. Thus, I have confidence that I will be able to communicate effectively with stakeholders from a diverse background.

**Analytic skills**

The company wants someone that performs analyses, builds models, and designs experiments. These are the skills that we learn in STA303. So far, the models we have learned are linear mixed model and general linear model. We will be able to model a wide variety of scenarios after this course.

The company wants someone who is familiar with ggplot. We have been using ggplot in data exploration task. This will again be inevitable component in our final project report where we will have to present data visualization using ggplot. 

**Connection to Studies**

My goal in professional development task is to learn to collaborate with classmates over Github. I will not only develop team skills, but also learn to use the collaborative tools that are widely used in the industry.  In addition, I have learned a lot of statistical knowledge from courses in university including STA303. I have a strong understanding of statistical concepts and model that is pivotal to the success of this job.
