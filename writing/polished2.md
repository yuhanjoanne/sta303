# *Dos* and *Don'ts* when Giving Peer Feedback

Giving feedback is important for helping others improve their work. I will discuss some do's and don'ts when giving feedback, so that we can help others more effectively.

Do's:

1. Get to the point.

People sometimes try to be polite by sugar coating their criticism. While this may help with your peersâ€™ ego, it could also confuse them. They may not be able to truly comprehend how serious their mistakes are or even recognize the mistakes. I would recommend getting straight to the points. 

2. Give references

When you make any kind of recommendations to your peers, it would be very helpful to them if you could direct them to additional sources of information or references that could help them. If you make only a short comment, your peers may not be able to understand you and how to improve their work. They may need to ask you for more information and help. So, giving them the references in the first place makes it a much more effective communication.

Don'ts

1. Do not make any assumptions

Often, people hesitate to criticize, because they cannot fully understand what their peers are trying to say. They would assume their peers have the right ideas, but just not using the right words and grammar. I would recommend that whenever you are in doubt, do not make any assumptions, simply challenge your peers. In the case that they do have the right ideas, that are communicated poorly, you would be helping them to improve their writing.

Those are my recommendations on how to give feedbacks. I hope everyone can provide helpful feedbacks.
